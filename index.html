Rock paper scissors
        Need three choices Rock, Paper, Scissors
        put them into and array and call them through the use of a random number generator
        if user has rock and computer has paper computer wins
        if user ha paper and computer has scissors computer wins
        if user has scissors and computer has rock computer wins : user has scissors then tie : 
        
        
Human vs Computer
        Need Imput from Human, 1 of 3 options
            Need case insensative input from user. possible spelling forgiveness in one package (possible and word that starts with R P S)
        Need random output from computer, 1 of 3 options
        Need to display outcomes of matches
            two parameters: playerSelection and computerSelection
            sting declares the winner of match and explains why "You lose. Paper beats rock."
